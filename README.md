# Create videos of activities from PDEs and coupled oscillators

In this repository, there are two files to create videos of the activity of 
1. a reaction diffusion pde. This is done by running
   `python run_2d.py`
2. and of a coupled oscillator system. This is done by running
   `python run_sle.py`

The dynamical states are report in this article [https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04053].
